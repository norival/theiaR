## TheiaR package

The TheiaR package intends to provide a clean interface to download and manage
data issued by [Theia](https://theia.cnes.fr/atdistrib/rocket/#/home).


## Quick start

### Create a TheiaAuht object

To search and download data fro Theia, you need to register to their
[website](https://sso.theia-land.fr/theia/register/register.xhtml).
Once you have credentials, store them in simple text file, let's say `auth.txt`.
